/**
 * An implementation of Drawing that is custom made to support storing figures
 * that represent objects in board games and collaborate with factories and
 * strategies to make board game graphics building and manipulation easy and
 * make the graphics look appealing.
 *
 * This is a Frozen Spot in the BoardGame framework.
 *
 * It acts as observer of a board game via the BoardGameObserver interface.
 *
 * Responsibility: A) To facilitate storing BoardFigures (pieces and props)
 *
 * B) To populate the collection of figures based upon a supplied factory.
 *
 * C) To react to game state changes of piece movement and prop changes via the
 * observer, and ensure the graphical output is esthetical pleasing.
 *
 * Collaborators: A) FigureFactory, an abstract factory to deliver the
 * BoardFigure instances representing pieces and the immovable objects (props).
 * B) PositioningStrategy, a strategy to adjust a figure's positioning so it
 * appears pleasing on the background (e.g. center a piece on a chess board
 * square) C) BoardFigure, the factory is required to deliver board figures as
 * the positioning strategy will only adjust positions of these D)
 * BoardActionTool, is the obvious choice of a tool to manipulate the figures
 * representing pieces and props as it will invoke their associated commands E)
 * the underlying game domain code, via the BoardGameObserver protocol - the
 * BoardDrawing must be notified of pieces moved in the game so it can update
 * the graphics appropriately. F) PropAppearanceStrategy, the strategy for
 * calculating a new appearance of a prop when the board drawing receives a
 * change event.
 *
 * This implementation can handle having multiple pieces on a single location,
 * as known in the Backgammon type of games.
 *
 * It cannot handle games where pieces are generated or destroyed during a game.
 * For chess and backgammon, provide an "out of game" position to move captured
 * or born off pieces.
 *
 * It cannot handle games where the pieces partly overlap because no real
 * Z-ordering of graphics is implemented.
