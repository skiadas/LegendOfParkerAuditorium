/**
 * A Command pattern to encapsulate method calls on a board game based upon
 * clicking or moving graphical figures on the graphical display. Typical
 * examples: A) Moving a graphical pawn image over a chess board image should be
 * tied to a command to move the pawn in the underlying chess domain code; B)
 * clicking a card image in a memory game should 'flip' the card.
 *
 * Collaborators: BoardActionTool and BoardFigure. The standard sequence is to
 * create a BoardFigure with an instance of a command. Next the user will
 * move/click on a BoardFigure using the BoardActionTool which knows the
 * protocol: The BoardActionTool will invoke method 'setFromCoordinates' on the
 * mouse down click on a BoardFigure and invoke the 'setToCoordinates' and next
 * 'execute' on mouse up.
 *
 * A final collaborator is of course the game domain object itself. Typically
 * this is assigned in the constructor of objects implementing this interface.
 *
 * Responsibilities: A) translate mouse clicks/mouse drags on BoardFigure into
 * domain specific game state changes by implementing the 'execute' method B)
 * the execute method is responsible for range checking the mouse coordinates so
 * no illegal parameters are passed to the game instance.
