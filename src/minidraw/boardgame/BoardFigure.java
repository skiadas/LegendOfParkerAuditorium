/**
 * A Figure specifically representing some object in a board game, like a
 * checker, a die, a card, or some other actionable object like a button.
 *
 * There are two types: movable objects (like checkers that can be moved by the
 * mouse), and props (like a die that cannot be moved but only clicked to
 * perform some action).
 *
 * The BoardFigure role is intimately related to the BoardActionTool role as
 * they have a well defined protocol:
 *
 * A BoardActionTool will ONLY click or move BoardFigure objects. Once the
 * tool's mouse up event is called, the method 'performAction' is called on the
 * BoardFigure.
 *
 * A BoardFigure must be associated a command object, i.e. an instance of a
 * command pattern. It is this object's 'execute' method that gets invoked on
 * mouse up events from the BoardActionTool.
