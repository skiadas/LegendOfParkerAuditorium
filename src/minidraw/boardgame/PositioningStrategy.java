/**
 * This role defines a strategy (strategy pattern) encapsulating the algorithms
 * to calculate the proper graphical position (x,y) for a figure that is located
 * on a given location on a board game.
 *
 * Collaborators: BoardDrawing that uses this strategy during initialization of
 * the collection of figures (to position figures correctly based upon the
 * game's layout of pieces) and during moves (to adjust a user's inaccurate
 * dragging of a figure representing a figure).
 *
 * The typical example is a mouse drag of a chess piece to a square. In most
 * cases the piece will not be positioned by the user on the exact center
 * position of the square. The BoardDrawing will request its PositioningStrategy
 * object to calculate the correct central position and then move the figure for
 * perfect centering.
 *
 * Invariant: The positions returned by the calculate method must be
 * non-overlapping for disjoint locations. That is, if positions returned by the
 * positioning strategy for location X could be mistaken as belonging to
 * location Y, MiniDraw.BoardGame will become very confused. The user will
 * probably as well.
