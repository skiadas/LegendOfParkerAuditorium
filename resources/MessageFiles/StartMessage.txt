On a dark and spooky night at Hanover College, something
tragic happened that closed Parker Auditorium forever...

A student was dared to break into Parker Auditorium and
stay the whole night inside. While inside weird things
started happening, the student started to hear suspicious
noises like voices and doors started closing on their own.
As scared as he was he was determined to stay in Parker
all night. The student never made it out and was never
heard from again, closing Parker Auditorium forever!
No one dares to enter Parker and it is said that the student
along with the other spirits haunt anyone who dares to enter.
